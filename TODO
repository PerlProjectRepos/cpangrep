* Make 'stest' go away and generate the list of slabs
** Update pointer to slabs atomically
   So we can build a new index and do a simple rename in redis to activate it
* Consistent use of config
* Stop using Tie::Redis in such a stupid/insane way
* Use Redis::Queue (or similar)?
* Tests
** Make unit testable
** Using fakecpan for end to end type tests
* Complex search
** dist:...
** author:..?
* Cleanup about page
* Line numbering
* Abstract when hovering over a dist name
  (using metacpan API underneath?)
* File displaying / syntax hilighting
* De-dupe
** Matches in same file
** File level (MD5?)
** Too many matches in distro (more...)
* API
