* Why is something leaking Redis clients (part of the Search.pm refactor maybe?)

* Consistent use of config
* Caching (at least for basic paging to avoid searches all the time)

* Stop using Tie::Redis in such a stupid/insane way
* Consider using 0MQ or something other than Redis for queueing
* Tests
** Make unit testable
** Using fakecpan for end to end type tests
* Complex search
** dist:...
   searching a specific dist
   searching all dists matching something
** author:..?
* Cleanup about page
* Line numbering
* Abstract when hovering over a dist name
  (using metacpan API underneath?)
* File displaying / syntax hilighting
* De-dupe
** Matches in same file
** File level (MD5?)
** Too many matches in distro (more...)
* API
