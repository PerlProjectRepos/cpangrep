=head1 CPAN Grep

This is the code behind L<http://grep.cpan.me>. Unless you want to add
something you probably want to use the site, not try and install this ;-)

To index the whole of CPAN takes an hour or two on a good box. For development
I currently build an index of just part of CPAN (all dists under /id/D/). You
can do this by C<grep 'D/D./' 02packages.details.txt.gz> and re-adding the
header. Hopefully soon L<fakecpan|http://www.fakecpan.org> will provide a
solution to this.

=item * cpangrep-index

Run with cpangrep-index --cpan_dir /path/to/cpan --slab_dir /data/cpangrep/extract

=item * WWW::CPANGrep

The web frontend. Run with starman -Ilib lib/WWW/CPANGrep.pm or other plack

There's also a version that wraps this in L<Plack::Debug> in F<debug.psgi>.

=item * cpangrep-matcher

Backend workers that do the matching, based on a redis queue.

=item * Redis

A Redis server (or several for the live version) are used for queuing jobs and
also resolving matches.
